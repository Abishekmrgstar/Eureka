# Eureka
Eureka is an NLP-based solution for automating exploratory understanding analysis. It handles document extraction from urls, summarization using the `distilbart-cnn-12-6` model, similarity search with FAISS, and PDF generation. Integrated into a flask app, it streamlines insights from various types of documents by accepting diverse URLs.
